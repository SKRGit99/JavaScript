/*
1. Variables in JavaScript - var, let and const;

Variables are containers for storing data values.
In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare a variable:
1. var
2. let
3. const

var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned.
let is block-scoped and can be reassigned but not redeclared.
const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or redeclared.


2. Data Types in JavaScript : Primitive and Non-Primitive
Data types specify the type of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program.

[a] Primitive Data Types: 

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable primitive value, often used as object property identifiers.
BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision, allowing for the representation of very large numbers.

[b] Non-Primitive Data Types:
Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be of any data type.

Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of values, accessible by their index.

Function: A block of reusable code that can be defined once and executed multiple times.

3. Operators in JavaScript - Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, etc
